<h1><a href="index.html">twistedActor</a>: Version History</h1>

<h3>1.0.2+ 2014-11-17</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Added "showReplies" arguments to device commands.
</ul>

<h3>1.0.2 2014-10-31</h3>

<ul>
    <li>DeviceActor: added a new property "model".
    <li>DeviceSet: added a new argument "slot" to _addDevCallbacks and _removeDevCallbacks.
    <li>Actor: the default help command now strips a leading "!" from the doc string, since that is used as a signal to Doxygen.
    <li>ActorDevice: added property "model".
</ul>

<h3>1.0.1 2014-10-30</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Improve the state messages in DevCmdVar resulting from failed CmdVar callback.
    <li>Added from __future__ import print_function and updated print statements accordingly.
    <li>Made the doc strings compatible with doxygen (""" -> """!) and fixed the errors reported by Doxygen.
</ul>

<h3>1.0.0 2014-10-28</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Bug fix: Device's connection state callback did not detect if a connection failed or was failing.
    <li>Bug fix: FileLogger would needlessly reject basePath if it did not include a directory.
</ul>

<h3>0.9.4 2014-10-21</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Overhauled DeviceSet.replaceDev to make its behavior safer and more predictable:
    <ul>
        <li>Initialize the new device.
        <li>Disconnect the replaced device, instead of merely sending INIT.
        <li>Fixed a bug whereby DeviceSet would attempt to send a status command after disconnecting.
        <li>Replace the device even if connecting and initializing the new device fails.
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3>0.9.3 2014-09-24</h3>

<ul>

</ul>

<h3>0.9.2 2014-08-29</h3>

<ul>

    <li>Enabled generation of Doxygen documentation.
    <li>Added link to Doxygen documentation in main manual and created this version history file.
</ul>

<h3>0.9.1 2014-08-27</h3>

<p>This version requires RO package 3.5.3.

<ul>
    <li>BaseActor now refuses to start, with a suitable error message, if the user port is in use.
