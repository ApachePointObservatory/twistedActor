<h1><a href="index.html">twistedActor</a>: Version History</h1>

<h3>1.1.0b1 2015-10-14</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Add a generic parser. Not polished
</ul>

<h3>1.0.7 2015-06-04</h3>

<ul>
    <li>CommandQueue.addCmd: if the provided command does not have a cmdVerb then provide one named "dummy".
    <li>testUtils.startLogging: if the log directory does not exist then create it.
</ul>

<h3>1.0.6 2015-03-10</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Remove Device.startCmdList
    <li>Change DeviceSet.startCmdDict to call Device.startCmd for each command in the list of commands; this means each Device must be capable of handling many commands in a row, e.g. by using a CommandQueue if queuing is required.
    <li>expandUserCmd is now available as a free function.
</ul>

<h3>1.0.5 2015-02-05</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Bug fix: DeviceSet.startCmd and startCmdDict did not wait for all device commands to finish if a device had more than one command.
</ul>

<h3>Documentation update 2015-01-13</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Added a software license (BSD-3 in doc/license.txt) and a readme file (ReadMe.md).
</ul>

<h3>1.0.4 2015-01-07</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Improved error message when a linked command (instance of LinkCommands) fails.
    <li>DeviceSet: simplified and rationalized the handling of callback functions in the startCmd methods:
    <ul>
        <li>The value returned by the callback is ignored, instead of being used to start a new device command. This was a feature that was not being used and greatly complicated the code.
        <li>Failure of a callback result in a traceback, but does not result in failure of the command.
        <li>Improved the error reported if a device command fails.
    </ul>
    <li>Bug fix: DeviceSet.startCmd ignored the timeLim argument.
    <li>Bug fix: DeviceSet.expandSlotList ignored the connOnly argument.
</ul>

<h3>1.0.3 2014-12-16</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Added "showReplies" arguments to device commands.
</ul>

<h3>1.0.2 2014-10-31</h3>

<ul>
    <li>DeviceActor: added a new property "model".
    <li>DeviceSet: added a new argument "slot" to _addDevCallbacks and _removeDevCallbacks.
    <li>Actor: the default help command now strips a leading "!" from the doc string, since that is used as a signal to Doxygen.
    <li>ActorDevice: added property "model".
</ul>

<h3>1.0.1 2014-10-30</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Improve the state messages in DevCmdVar resulting from failed CmdVar callback.
    <li>Added from __future__ import print_function and updated print statements accordingly.
    <li>Made the doc strings compatible with doxygen (""" -> """!) and fixed the errors reported by Doxygen.
</ul>

<h3>1.0.0 2014-10-28</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Bug fix: Device's connection state callback did not detect if a connection failed or was failing.
    <li>Bug fix: FileLogger would needlessly reject basePath if it did not include a directory.
</ul>

<h3>0.9.4 2014-10-21</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Overhauled DeviceSet.replaceDev to make its behavior safer and more predictable:
    <ul>
        <li>Initialize the new device.
        <li>Disconnect the replaced device, instead of merely sending INIT.
        <li>Fixed a bug whereby DeviceSet would attempt to send a status command after disconnecting.
        <li>Replace the device even if connecting and initializing the new device fails.
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3>0.9.3 2014-09-24</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Modernized the exception catching syntax.
</ul>

<h3>0.9.2 2014-08-29</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Standardized capitalization of keywords output by TwistedActor to camelCase with leading lowercase. Most started with an initial capital letter.
    <li>Enabled generation of Doxygen documentation.
    <li>Added link to Doxygen documentation in main manual and created this version history file.
</ul>

<h3>0.9.1 2014-08-27</h3>

<p>This version requires RO package 3.5.3.

<ul>
    <li>BaseActor now refuses to start, with a suitable error message, if the user port is in use.
    <li>Bug fix: DispatcherWrapper.queueCmd did not notice a command failure if the specified callback codes did not include failure codes.
</ul>

<h3>0.9.0 2014-08-29</h3>

<p>First version with version history.
